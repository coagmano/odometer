Odometer
========

## Changes in this fork
Added option `digitSpacer` which sets which character is used to space each
    number evenly.

Using certain fonts, the default value (`8`) is not the widest character and so
    some numbers would be cut off when rendered.

## Original Readme

Odometer is a Javascript and CSS library for smoothly transitioning numbers.
